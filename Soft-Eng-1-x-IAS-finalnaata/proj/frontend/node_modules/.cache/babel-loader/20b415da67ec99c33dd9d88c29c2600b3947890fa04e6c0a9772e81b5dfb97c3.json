Of\n            course, herbal medicine is still available in the market. Though,\n            with the variety of medicine available in today’s world, navigating\n            through them can be a challenge. This is exactly the challenge that\n            the makers of St. John’s PharmAssist planned to solve.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            St. John’s PharmAssist is a directory-style website that aims to\n            provide its users the best and easiest experience for looking up\n            medicinal information online. St. John’s PharmAssist provides a wide\n            variety of information, from the common medicinal information such\n            as the medicine name and generic name, to specific information such\n            as possible side effects and pharmacies wherein said medicine are\n            available.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n\n      <br />\n      <div className=\"about-story\">\n        <h2>The Story Behind The Name</h2>\n        <p>\n          The team wanted to have a name that would instantly capture people’s\n          attention, explain the project just by the name itself, and make sure\n          that people would remember it instantly. With the name St. John’s\n          PharmAssist, it surely achieves all of the said criteria that the team\n          was looking for.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The name St. John’s PharmAssist is derived from the word ‘pharmacist’,\n          meaning a person who is qualified for preparing and dispensing medical\n          drugs. With a little engineering of the word with the goal of the\n          team, ‘PharmAssist’ was created by combining the words ‘pharmacy’ and\n          ‘assist’, yet sounding like the word ‘pharmacist’. Overall, the word\n          ‘PharmAssist’ means “to help someone by doing a share of the work\n          about the art, practice, preserving, and dispensing of medicinal\n          drugs”.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          St. John from the name came from St. John’s wort, an herbal medicine\n          dating all the way back from the first century, used for a variety of\n          conditions such as kidney and lung ailments, insomnia, depression, and\n          aid wound healing. Nowadays, herbal medicine is used for treating\n          premenstrual syndrome, menopause, inflammation of wounds, and some\n          mental conditions such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), obsessive\n          compulsive disorder (OCD), and social phobia. Coincidentally, the\n          herbal plant was named from St. John the Baptist, as its flowers and\n          buds were mostly harvested during St. John’s Feast Day every 24th June,\n          making the plant to have more healing and magical powers more\n          effective when harvested on the said date.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Additionally, St. John from the name of the website was an answer or\n          a continuation of the project of 2 out of 4 members of the team. These \n          people are{\" \"}\n          <i>\n            <b>John Paul Amegleo</b>\n          </i>\n          , and{\" \"}\n          <i>\n            <b>Krisia Lahoz</b>\n          </i>\n          . Their project during one of their subjects of their 2nd Year is\n          named <b>St. John’s Hospital</b>, a reservation-type application made from\n          Java wherein its users can book and schedule an appointment with its\n          available doctors, and see the status of their booking. They saw an\n          opportunity to continue on their work with another project that fits\n          their initial one.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <br />\n      <div className=\"about-teamhead\">\n        <div className=\"team-intro\">\n          <h2>The People Behind The Project</h2>\n          <p>\n            St. John’s PharmAssist is made by a team of 3rd year BS in Computer\n            Science students for their Software Engineering subject, improved \n            for their Information Assurance and Security subject.
